The SLAMStruder is a 3D printing extruder designed for use on six-axis robotic arms. The goal of the SLAMStruder is to enable extrusion of 3D printable plastics in free-air instead of in layers. When paired with a six-axis robotic arm, the SLAMStruder can be used to print pre-programmed, high quality 3D lattices in a layer-free manner.

## Features

- A 1.2mm nozzle opening for extrusion of large, self-supporting filaments
- A slim nozzle design to maneuver into tight corners
- Digital hotend temperature control with PID feedback
- Extrusion speed control
- An attached blower fan with digital speed control for cooling filaments quickly.
- An additional servo-controlled rotational axis for increased position control. 
- On-board controls for setting hotend temperature, extrusion speed, fan speed, and servo angle.

## Potential applications
- Large-scale rapid prototyping
- Fabrication of structurally optimized spaceframes
- Formwork for concrete structures
- Generative art
